# Image_attachement_crud


I have implemented the feature to handle has_many images functionality. This enhancement includes integrating ActiveAdmin for image management.

Key Features:
Add and Remove Images:
Users can add or remove specific images for a particular record. This makes it easier to manage multiple images associated with a record.

Image Editing:
When editing an image, the URL of that particular image will update dynamically to reflect the changes.
Note: If an image is not provided (nil), it will not cause any issues during the operation.
